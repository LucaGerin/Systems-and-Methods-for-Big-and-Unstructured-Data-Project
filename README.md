# Systems and Methods for Big and Unstructured Data Project

This project was completed as part of the Systems and Methods for Big and Unstructured Data course at Politecnico di Milano during the academic year 2023-2024.

## Overview

The primary objective of this project was to select a DB Technology from among Neo4j, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch, along with a dataset containing a minimum of 20,000 data points. The project involved importing the dataset into the chosen DBMS and performing diverse queries of varying complexities to showcase a range of capabilities.

## Group Work

Given our group's composition of three individuals, we worked on two separate DBMS technologies to cover a wider spectrum of techniques and functionalities.
